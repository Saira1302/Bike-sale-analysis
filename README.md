# First-Bike-sale-project-
This is my first project as a data analyst, focusing on analyzing a dataset of bike sales from a bike shop. The dataset contains customer demographics, bike details, and sales information. The goal is to derive insights into sales patterns and customer profiles and to present these findings through an interactive dashboard.
