# First-Bike-sale-project-
This is my first project as a data analyst, focusing on analyzing a dataset of bike sales from a bike shop. The dataset contains customer demographics, bike details, and sales information. The goal is to derive insights into sales patterns and customer profiles and to present these findings through an interactive dashboard.

# Dataset Highlights:

Customer Information: Income, marital status, gender, age, education, occupation, region, number of children.
Bike Details: Bike category, brand, price.
Sales Information: Purchase date, store location, sales channel.

# Key Activities:

1. Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values and standardized formats.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Descriptive Statistics: Summary of customer demographics and sales data.
   - Sales Trends: Analysis of sales over time and by category.
   - Customer Segmentation: Grouping based on demographics and purchasing behavior.
   - Correlation Analysis: Relationships between attributes and sales.
   3. Visualization: Created charts to represent income distribution, sales by category, demographic insights, and time series analysis.
